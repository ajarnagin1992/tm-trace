# Turing Machine Parser and Trace Program


## How to use:

 1. Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (must be version > 3.0)
 2. Install antlr4 using pip in python with the following command: `pip install antlr4-python3-runtime` or `<pathtopip> install antlr4-python3-runtime`
 3. Run the main file tmtrace in a shell with following command: `python -m tmtrace <pathtofile> <word>`  
    Alternatively, you can run the command without the filepath or word argument, and the script will  
    prompt you for them.
